Intents
An Intent object carries information that the Android system uses to determine which component to start (such as the exact component name
or component category that should receive the intent), plus information that the recipient component uses in order to properly perform the
action (such as the action to take and the data to act upon).
Intent is a class which allows all android components except content providers because it access only data.
Intents are of two types:
Explicit Intents,
Implicit Intents.
