        THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL ::
        Patty the milkmaid had just finished milking her cow and had two full pails of fresh creamy milk.
        She put both pails on a stick and set off to the market to sell her pails of milk.
        Along the way she started to think of all the milk in her pails and all the money she would get for them.
        ‘Once I get the money, I’ll buy a chicken’, she thought.
        ‘The chicken will lay eggs and I will get more chickens.
        They’ll all lay eggs and I can sell them for more money.
        Then I’ll buy the house on the hill and be the envy of everyone in the village.
        They’ll ask me to sell the chicken farm, but I’ll toss my head like this and refuse’.
        So saying, Patty, the milkmaid tossed her head and dropped her pails.
        The milk spilled onto the ground while Patty cried.

        MORAL :
                Do not count your Chickens before they hatch.
         THE TALE OF THE PENCIL ::
        Raj was upset because he had done poorly in his English test.
        His grandmother sat with him and gave him a pencil.
        A puzzled Raj looked at his grandma and said he didn’t deserve a pencil after his performance in the test.
        His grandma explained, ‘You can learn a great many things from this pencil because it is just like you.
        It experiences a painful sharpening, just the way you have experienced the pain of not doing well on your test.
        However, it will help you be a better student.
        Just as all the good that comes from the pencil is from within itself, you will also find the strength to overcome this hurdle.
        And finally, just as this pencil will make its mark on any surface, you too shall leave your mark on anything you choose to’.
        Raj was immediately consoled and promised himself that he would do better.
        MORAL :
                We all have the strength to be who we wish to be.
        THE PROUD ROSE ::

        Once upon a time there was a rose who was very proud of her beautiful looks.
        Her only disappointment was that she  grew next to an ugly cactus.
        Every day, the rose would insult the cactus on his looks while the cactus stayed quiet.
        All the other plants in the garden tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own good looks.
        One summer, the well present in the garden grew dry and there was no water for the plants.
        The rose began to wilt. She saw a sparrow dip her beak into the cactus for some water.
        Though ashamed, she asked the cactus if she too could have some water.
        The kind cactus readily agreed and they both got through the tough summer as friends.
        MORAL :
                Never judge someone by the way they look.
